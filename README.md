# Student Academic Grades Prediction and Analysis Using Clusting Algorithm
Students low academic performances in the engineering subjects has been a long-standing problem. The main goal of this project is to propose a model using data mining techniques to predict student’s overall performance in higher education. Data mining clustering algorithms will be used to extract the essential information from student’s data and finding the relationships between factors influencing student performances.
#Aim:
To create a model to analyze and predict students academic performance using factors of students based on their previous results (e.g. CGPA , activities, skills).
